This file contains information about the steps taken by Run_analysis. 
=========

Preliminary steps
------------

1. Download the data from this url: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
2. Unzip the data into a folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Steps in Run_Analysis
------------

1. Loads test and training data sets and corresponding source variable names into data tables
2. Combines test and training data frames using rbind
3. Loads activity IDs using cbind
4. Extracts mean and standard deviation variables
5. Combines the data frames to produce one data frame containing the subjects, measurements and activities
6. Replaces activity IDs with the activity labels 
7. Produces a data.table combined data frame as the first expected output
8. Applies the mean and standard deviation calculations across the groups
9. Produces "Tidy_data.txt" as the final output

Final dataset
------------

The final dataset, "Tidy_data.txt" is in this repository. It contains one row for each subject/activity pair. Columns represent the subject, activity and each feature that was a mean or standard deviation variable from the original dataset.
